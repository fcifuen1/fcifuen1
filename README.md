## Hi there, I'm Federico üëãüèº

I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I build computer systems to make Wi-Fi more private, but honestly, I just enjoy learning how computers communicate with each other.

üíª I've interned at Apple, Johns Hopkins APL, and Sandia National Labs to work on cool wireless systems and network security projects

üõú Research Interests: Privacy in wireless systems, Network systems security, and Network infrastructure design and analysis

üåê Check out my work at [fc8.web.illinois.edu](https://fc8.web.illinois.edu). **I'm currently on the job market!**

## Projects

*   **Device Fingerprinting in MAC Randomized Networks** (Spring 2024 - Present)
    *   Developing a machine learning model with XGBoost for fingerprinting random MAC addresses.
    *   Applying weighted functions and cosine similarity on MAC-layer data analysis for flow classification.
    *   Implemented a C parser to extract wireless and flow-level features of Wi-Fi traffic in public networks.
*   **Linking Devices Using Wi-Fi MAC Randomization at MobiCom '23** (Spring 2024)
    *   Designed an attack linking vendor-specific elements and sequence numbers in Wi-Fi probing in C.
    *   Demonstrated a 45%+ reduction in device counts despite MAC randomization in dense networks.
*   **Passive Device Identification with Timing Analysis** (Spring 2023)
    *   Designed and implemented a time-based pattern recognition attack on Wi-Fi network discovery in C.
    *   Presented results at a workshop, showing a 94.1% success rate in detecting unique mobile devices.
*   **Defending Wi-Fi Network Discovery from Time Correlation Tracking** (Winter 2021)
    *   Designed MAC address randomization with randomized jitter as a defense for time-based tracking.
    *   Developed packet management with the Linux Netlink API and a packet tracking algorithm in C.
